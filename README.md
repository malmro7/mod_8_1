# mod_8_1

This project was solving a situation where a grocery store would have a txt file containing a history of each item sold throughout the day, and wanted to parse that data to get aggregated sales totals for each item, or retrieve sales totals for a particular item. I think my Python code was particularly well done, and used a good data structure for the input. I could enhance my code by breaking up my C++ code to be more modular, and there was no error handling for files not opening. I could have definitely broken that function up abit to be more readable. Unfortunately, the program basically can't work if the files don't open but I could have provided some information to the user in that case atleast. The Python code was the most difficult to write, as I don't have as much experience with that language as I do with C++, and I also haven't used Python recently. I overcame that by reading Python documentation to brush up on what I forgot. I think the skills I developed in Python as well as using C++ and Python together will be transferable to other courses and projects. This project is readable because of comments and having a proper style throughout. Any line that wasn't self explanatory was commented. Everything is divided nicely into functions that should be easy to maintain.
